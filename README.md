## Description

Bomberman is a game in which the player controls a robot that places bombs to destroy obstacles and defeat enemies. The goal is to eliminate all enemies and find the hidden exit before time runs out.

Similar games include Robo warrior, which also uses bombs, and Pengo, where players move blocks to defeat enemies. Bomberman became popular for its simple but strategic gameplay and multiplayer mode, influencing other games like Dynablaster and Mega Bomberman.
